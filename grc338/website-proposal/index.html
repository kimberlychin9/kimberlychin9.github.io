					<p> Posh Pottery out of Morro Bay is anything but "posh". We like to get dirty and work with our hands to make some of the most rugged and refined pieces of pottery you will ever find! There is nothing quite like making something that came from your hands. Founders Debbie and Claire put their hobbies into a business over 8 years ago, and Posh Pottery came to be. </p>

                    <p>Our class schedule for the month is provided upon request and is posted at the Morro Bay events center downtown. Because we are a small studio, we can't accomodate too many classes, but we will have them about 8 times a month. Please contact us via email or phone to learn more about times and skills being taught.</p>
					
                    <h2>Events</h2>
                
                    <p>  Posh Pottery has hosted every type of event from birthday parties to bachelorette parties! We can accommodate up to 10 guests per party, and we can set up a fun activity to do. Posh Pottery does ask that your provide your own snacks and beverages, but to be mindful when consuming them because some of the materials that we work with in the pottery can be harmful to ingest! </p><!-- This is a placeholder!
