                <h2>About Buona Tavola</h2>
                
                <h3>In San Luis Obispo since 1992</h3>
                <p>For well over two decades, Antonio Varia has been delighting the discerning palates of Central Coast residents with an inventive Northern Italian cuisine. Opened in 1992, Buona Tavola (meaning “good table”) is the realization of a dream. Working as an apprentice in the restaurants of his native Northern Italy, Antonio continued his training in Europe’s finest hotels. He honed his skills on the Princess Cruise lines, and as executive chef in several award-winning Los Angeles eateries. Buona Tavola in downtown San Luis Obispo opened to rave reviews. The esteemed Zagat Survey gave it the highest ratings of any restaurant in the county, calling it “superb dining” with “great wine” in a “charming setting…one of the best between Los Angeles and San Francisco”.</p>
                
                <h3>Paso Robles</h3>
                <p>A decade later – responding to clamor from loyal patrons and new arrivals alike – Antonio opened a new location in downtown Paso Robles. Happily situated at the seat of our county’s bountiful wine country, Buona Tavola Paso Robles offers the same superb cuisine and impeccable service in a quietly elegant setting.</p>
                
                <h3>Antonio's main ingredient</h3>
                <p>Both restaurants offer Antonio’s unmatchable cuisine for offsite events, such as weddings, wine dinners and private parties. The skill that comes with hard-won years of experience and the area’s freshest seasonal ingredients are apparent in every dish that is served, every day of the week. Plus the main ingredient straight from Antonio himself : “I Cook With Love!”</p>
